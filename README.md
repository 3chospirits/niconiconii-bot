# NICONICONII-BOT ADVANCED CODE

This branch was solely made for intermediate developers who wants cleaner
and more understandable code to work with.

## Install the bot

### Windows

```ps
git clone https://github.com/3chospirits/niconiconii-bot/tree/improved niconiconii-bot
cd niconiconii-bot
```

After installation, you will have to rename `config.example.json` as `config.json` with your own data to run the bot

When that is done, you can directly run the bot after installing the dependencies
with `npm i`

However if you don't want the bot to start after installing the dependencies, you 
can still run the bot with `npm run start`
